// Note: The auth-controller.js calls generateOTP and verifyOTP.
// The generateOTP in auth-controller is for sending an OTP *after* user registration.
// The sendPhoneOTP handler in auth-controller calls generateOTP again for an arbitrary phone.
// The verifyPhone handler in auth-controller calls verifyOTP.
// This util needs to align with those expectations.
// The sms-service.js also has an OTPManager which is more complete but requires Redis.
// This util is a simpler stub.
